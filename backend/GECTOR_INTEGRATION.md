# GECToR Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the integration of the GECToR (Grammatical Error Correction Transformer) model into the resume analysis system. GECToR is a transformer-based model for grammatical error correction that provides enhanced accuracy for detecting and correcting spelling and grammar issues.

## Components

### 1. GECToRAnalysisService

A dedicated service that implements the GECToR model for text analysis:

- Loads and manages the GECToR model
- Processes text to identify spelling and grammar errors
- Provides confidence scores for each correction
- Returns structured results compatible with the existing system

### 2. Validation Pipeline Integration

The ValidationPipeline has been enhanced to include GECToR as an additional validation method:

- Added `GECTOR_BASED` validation method
- Implemented spelling and grammar validation using GECToR
- Integrated GECToR results into the consensus-based validation system

### 3. TextAnalysisService Enhancement

The TextAnalysisService now supports GECToR-based analysis:

- Added `use_gector` parameter to enable/disable GECToR
- Implemented `analyze_with_gector()` method for direct GECToR analysis
- Updated the main analysis flow to use GECToR when enabled

## Usage

To use GECToR in your analysis:

```python
# Initialize with GECToR enabled
service = TextAnalysisService(enable_enhanced_analysis=True, use_gector=True)

# Analyze text with GECToR
result = service.analyze_with_confidence("Your resume text here")

# Or use GECToR directly
gector_result = service.analyze_with_gector("Your resume text here")
```

## Performance Comparison

A test suite has been implemented to compare the accuracy of GECToR with traditional NLP approaches:

- `test_gector_accuracy.py` provides detailed metrics on precision, recall, and F1 scores
- GECToR generally provides higher accuracy for complex grammar errors and context-dependent corrections
- Traditional NLP approaches may be faster for simple text analysis

## Implementation Notes

1. GECToR requires more computational resources than traditional NLP approaches
2. The system falls back to traditional methods if GECToR fails or is not available
3. The validation pipeline combines results from multiple methods for optimal accuracy

## Future Improvements

1. Implement model caching to improve performance
2. Add fine-tuning capabilities for resume-specific corrections
3. Explore hybrid approaches that combine GECToR with domain-specific rules
