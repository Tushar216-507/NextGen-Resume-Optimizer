# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the resume analyzer frontend to include a job type selector that allows users to specify their target job type. This information will be used to provide more accurate ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scoring by tailoring the analysis to job-specific requirements, keywords, and industry standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to select my target job type when uploading my resume, so that the ATS analysis is tailored to the specific role I'm applying for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upload interface loads THEN the system SHALL display a job type selector dropdown next to the file selection
2. WHEN the dropdown is opened THEN the system SHALL show a comprehensive list of job types including technical and non-technical roles
3. WHEN a job type is selected THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the selection to the user
4. WHEN no job type is selected THEN the system SHALL prevent analysis and show helper text guiding the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the job type selector to include relevant job categories for my field, so that I can find my target role easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN specialized roles are listed THEN the system SHALL include UI/UX Designer, Cybersecurity Analyst, Financial Analyst, and an "Other" option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the selected job type to be sent to the backend for analysis, so that my ATS score reflects job-specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analyze button is clicked THEN the system SHALL include the selected job type in the form data sent to the backend
2. WHEN job type data is sent THEN the system SHALL use the job type value (not display label) for backend processing
3. WHEN no job type is selected THEN the system SHALL default to "other" for backward compatibility
4. WHEN the backend receives job type data THEN the system SHALL log the job type for debugging purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about my job type selection, so that I can confirm my choice before analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job type is selected THEN the system SHALL display the selected job type in a highlighted container
2. WHEN the job type is displayed THEN the system SHALL show both an icon and the job type label
3. WHEN the selection changes THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
4. WHEN both file and job type are selected THEN the system SHALL enable the analyze button with appropriate styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to guide me through the selection process, so that I understand what information is required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN either file or job type is missing THEN the system SHALL show helper text indicating what's needed
2. WHEN the analyze button is disabled THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate why it cannot be clicked
3. WHEN the job type selector is displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the rest of the interface
4. WHEN analysis results are shown THEN the system SHALL display which job type was used for the analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the job type selector to integrate seamlessly with the existing UI, so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the job type selector is added THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing dark theme and color scheme
2. WHEN the dropdown is styled THEN the system SHALL use consistent colors, fonts, and spacing with existing components
3. WHEN the layout is updated THEN the system SHALL ensure proper responsive behavior on different screen sizes
4. WHEN icons are used THEN the system SHALL use Material Design icons consistent with the existing interface

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the job type feature to be backward compatible, so that existing functionality continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives requests without job type THEN the system SHALL default to "other" and continue processing
2. WHEN older API calls are made THEN the system SHALL maintain existing response formats
3. WHEN job type is not provided THEN the system SHALL still perform basic analysis without job-specific enhancements
4. WHEN errors occur in job type processing THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to standard analysis
