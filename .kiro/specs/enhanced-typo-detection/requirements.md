# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to significantly improve typo detection accuracy for resume text analysis by implementing a multi-layered approach that combines traditional NLP methods, modern transformer models, and domain-specific validation. The system should achieve high accuracy while maintaining reasonable performance for real-time resume analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker using the resume analyzer, I want highly accurate typo detection so that I can trust the suggestions and improve my resume quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes resume text THEN it SHALL achieve at least 85% F1 score for typo detection
2. WHEN multiple typos exist in a sentence THEN the system SHALL detect all typos with at least 80% recall
3. WHEN the system detects a typo THEN it SHALL provide a confidence score above 0.7 for high-quality suggestions
4. IF a word is a technical term or proper noun THEN the system SHALL not flag it as a typo

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want fast typo detection so that I can get immediate feedback while editing my resume.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a typical resume (500-1000 words) THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 3 seconds
2. WHEN the system processes text THEN it SHALL use efficient caching to avoid re-analyzing unchanged sections
3. IF the primary detection method fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative methods within 1 second

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want context-aware typo detection so that technical terms and industry jargon in my resume are handled correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters technical terms THEN it SHALL validate against technology and skill databases
2. WHEN analyzing different resume sections THEN it SHALL apply section-specific validation rules
3. WHEN a word appears in professional contexts THEN it SHALL consider industry-specific dictionaries
4. IF a word is commonly used in resumes THEN the system SHALL not flag it as incorrect

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want a robust multi-layered detection approach so that the system can handle various edge cases and maintain high accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the primary detection method has low confidence THEN the system SHALL use secondary validation methods
2. WHEN methods disagree on a suggestion THEN the system SHALL use ensemble voting to determine the final result
3. WHEN new typo patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL learn and improve detection accuracy
4. IF one detection layer fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with remaining layers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want meaningful explanations for typo corrections so that I can understand and learn from the suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system suggests a correction THEN it SHALL provide a clear explanation of the error type
2. WHEN multiple corrections are possible THEN it SHALL rank suggestions by relevance and confidence
3. WHEN a correction involves context THEN it SHALL explain why the suggestion fits the context better
4. IF the system is uncertain THEN it SHALL clearly indicate the confidence level and reasoning
