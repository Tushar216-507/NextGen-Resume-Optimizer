# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing resume analyzer backend to provide significantly improved accuracy in text quality analysis. The system will implement advanced techniques including context-aware analysis, domain-specific vocabulary handling, confidence scoring, and multi-layered validation to reduce false positives and improve detection of actual errors in resume text.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the system to accurately detect spelling mistakes without flagging technical terms and proper nouns, so that I receive relevant feedback for actual errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technical terms (JavaScript, Python, MongoDB, etc.) are encountered THEN the system SHALL NOT flag them as spelling errors
2. WHEN proper company names and technologies are used THEN the system SHALL maintain a comprehensive whitelist to avoid false positives
3. WHEN context suggests a technical term THEN the system SHALL use contextual analysis to validate spelling
4. WHEN confidence in a spelling correction is low THEN the system SHALL NOT suggest corrections below 80% confidence threshold

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the system to provide contextually appropriate grammar suggestions for professional resume language, so that corrections improve rather than harm my resume quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing grammar THEN the system SHALL prioritize resume-specific language patterns over general grammar rules
2. WHEN professional terminology is used correctly THEN the system SHALL NOT suggest changes to industry-standard phrasing
3. WHEN multiple grammar correction options exist THEN the system SHALL choose the most professional and concise option
4. WHEN grammar suggestions are made THEN the system SHALL provide explanations for why changes are recommended

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to implement confidence scoring for all suggestions, so that users receive only high-quality recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any correction is suggested THEN the system SHALL calculate and store a confidence score (0-100%)
2. WHEN confidence scores are below 80% THEN the system SHALL NOT present suggestions to users
3. WHEN multiple suggestions exist for the same error THEN the system SHALL rank them by confidence score
4. WHEN displaying suggestions THEN the system SHALL include confidence indicators for user awareness

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to provide detailed explanations for corrections, so that I can learn and make informed decisions about changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a spelling correction is suggested THEN the system SHALL provide the reason for the suggestion
2. WHEN a grammar issue is detected THEN the system SHALL explain the grammatical rule being violated
3. WHEN technical terms are involved THEN the system SHALL indicate if the term is recognized as valid technical vocabulary
4. WHEN corrections are contextual THEN the system SHALL explain why the context supports the suggestion

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the enhanced accuracy system to maintain fast performance while providing better results, so that user experience remains optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing resumes THEN the enhanced system SHALL complete analysis within 15 seconds for 10-page documents
2. WHEN accuracy improvements are implemented THEN processing time SHALL NOT increase by more than 50% compared to current system
3. WHEN multiple analysis layers are used THEN the system SHALL optimize processing through parallel execution where possible
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to faster methods while maintaining reasonable accuracy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the system to understand resume-specific language patterns and formatting, so that analysis is tailored to professional document standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bullet points and resume formatting are encountered THEN the system SHALL parse them correctly without grammar false positives
2. WHEN abbreviated forms common in resumes are used THEN the system SHALL recognize them as valid (e.g., "5+ years", "B.S.", "etc.")
3. WHEN action verbs in past tense are used THEN the system SHALL validate consistency within experience sections
4. WHEN quantified achievements are present THEN the system SHALL validate number-text agreement (e.g., "3 years" not "3 year")

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to implement multi-layered validation to cross-check suggestions, so that accuracy is maximized through redundant verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a potential error is detected THEN the system SHALL validate it through at least two different analysis methods
2. WHEN analysis methods disagree THEN the system SHALL use the more conservative approach (fewer false positives)
3. WHEN high-confidence errors are found THEN the system SHALL still perform secondary validation before suggesting corrections
4. WHEN validation layers conflict THEN the system SHALL log conflicts for continuous improvement of the analysis algorithms
